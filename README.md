# Vertical-Farming-Analytics
This project aims to bridge the current gap between controlled-environment agriculture and the computer vision and robotics fields. The intended outcome is to develop an open-source toolkit for plant analysis that can be adapted to container-size smart farms, vertical farms, or even small window farms at home. The project will enable farmers world wide to automate and optimize their food production.
